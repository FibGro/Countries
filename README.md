# Countries

Our objective in this project is to define how to use the financial resources effectively by categorizing the countries based on health and socio-economic factors that influence the overall development of the country. Thus, the HELP organization can deliver those resources to the country that need the most aid. In this project, we cluster countries by using the K-means clustering. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be utilized for dimension reduction and anomaly detection.
